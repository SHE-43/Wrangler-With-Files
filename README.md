# Wrangler-With-Files


This is one of the earliest data wrangling projects I've done for a tech-skills based interview.

The mission of the whole assignment was to go over a bunch of CSV files, edit and reformat them (for e.g.: change data types of some of the columns) and then save them all
in a final Excel/CSV file that has all the data combined for further analysis and ML algorithms.


There is only one script that does it all.

The script has been kept small and simple on purpose.


If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.


Thanks.
